# Strong and Vulnerable

As humans we are a strong and vulnerable people.   
Often we fear our humanity will push others away.   
That showing our vulnerability and flaws and incomplete parts will cause others to disdain us, resent us, or reject us.   
And indeed, sometimes that happens.   
But when we show our full humanity, and we find that instead others find us more lovable - at least the ones who accept us as we are, see the best in us, and are prepared to truly love us, we find that it is okay to “be me.”   
And it is okay to trust the love we receive, and to show up as our real and full selves.
