# Hard Things

I can do hard things.    
I am resilient.    
I can get through loss.    
I can get through heart break.    
I can get through failure.    
I can get through disappointment.    
I can recognize and admit my own shortcomings.    
I can face reality, and accept its invitation to dance.
