# It Started Out With Love

As it so often does, it started out with love.  
A spark, an idea, a generative force.  
A way where there appeared no way.  
In the midst of what's dying and ending,  
new life springing forth.  

When the waves of life come crashing  
in and out just like the tide  
sometimes it's all too much!  
...like drowning or spinning  
or being taken on an ininvited ride.  

But then other times the ride is fun!  
Like surfing, or skating,  
or riding fresh powder in the midday sun.  

Really it seems it's just all about how you take it.  
Clinging to control is an illusion just to fake it.  
Letting go and laying back is the only way to make it.  

Unexpected and amazing.  
Love springs forth in moments undetected.  
The unplanned and spontaneous actions  
which are our fundamental hopes and dreams projected  
into memories and lived experiences collected  
that serve to remind us that we all are souls connected.  

This unconditional love it leads to unity you see.  
It's not just you and me, it's always all about we.  
The love I feel for you and the love you feel for me,  
is a universal force that we tap into when we breath.  

It's a flow that keeps us going every day  
when inertia wants us slowing.  
The energy of life is pushing us forward  
to keep changing, evolving, and growing.  

It transforms and builds and transcends  
and invites us all along for the ride on each and every bend.  
What the journey will become   
whose to say where it will go or when it will end.  

And the destination's often taken  
as the only thing that matters  
when the truth is that the ride  
is where the life is if we can just   
accept it as a gift to experience now and then    
and maybe plant some seeds for  
whatever next adventure will then begin again.  

The questions is will you be  
awake enough to see it?  
And if so not just observe  
but take a step and live in it  
and embody it and be it?
