# Open Oh My Heart

Open, oh my heart!    
Open wide!   
Allow love's healing power   
to flow in and to flow out.   

Open, oh my heart!    
Open wide!   
Take up hope and joy.   
Cast aside fear and doubt.   

Open, oh my heart!    
Open wide!   
Sing your song!   
Oh yes, sing and shout!   

Open, oh my heart!    
Open wide!   
For life is burting within,   
just waiting to come out.   

So live!    
Do more than just survive.   
Keep going! Learn how to   
blossom, bloom, and thrive.
