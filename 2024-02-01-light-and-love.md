# Light and Love ❤️🕯️

Piercing through the clouds,
Shining at the dawn,
Rays of light, ever present,
Dancing like a skipping fawn.

This light it shines
So bright and brilliantly,
A physical manifestation
Of love that the eye can see.

For light and love are indeed
One and the same.
And when I think of you,
Love illuminates my every vein.
