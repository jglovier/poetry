# Fall

Fall.    
A season ends, another begins.    
But not yet.    
A seasons between seasons.    

A time for refreshing.    
A time for renewal.    
A time for reflecting.    
A time to rest.    
A time to breathe.    
A time to look, and see.    
A time to mourn the loss of what was.    
And a time to grieve.    

And a time for expectancy, and hope.    
For what is coming is just around the corner.    

The death of what was, is not the end of all things.    
It is the completion of a story.     
And a new beginning it will bring.
