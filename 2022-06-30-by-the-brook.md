# By the Brook

Sunshine peeking through the trees.   
Beautiful golden light illuminating their leaves.   
Photons dancing with radiant energy.   
Creating chlorophyl to feed   
these arms that party with the breeze.   

The sound of rushing water.   
It comes, it goes.   
It knows not where.   
And it does not care.   
Yet it carries with it some of my stess   
and in its place I find some rest.   

A respite for my mind, my heart, my soul.   
For these few precious moments   
I am reminded that I am whole.   

And wholly connected to everything in Creation.   
I remember my inner joy.   
And in my spirit I take flight to a higher elevation.
