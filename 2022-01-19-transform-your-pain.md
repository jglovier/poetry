# Transform Your Pain

What will you do with your pain today?    

Will you hold it inside?    
Will you give it away?    

Transform it!    
Turn pain into beauty, kindess, and love.    
And release it in ways that fly like a dove.    

A symbol of hope to remind us     
that pain is not the end.    
It’s simply a stage that occurs while you mend.    

And let pain remind us that we all suffer here.    
And may compassion grow     
in that space watered by tears.    

Remember how we are all connected —     
each of us has a place of need.    
So instead of pain, pass along a loving seed.
