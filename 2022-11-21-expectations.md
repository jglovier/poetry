# Expectations

How do you handle  
all of the expectations of life,  
and of the world?  

How do handle  
your own expectations?  

In some ways,  
expectation and anticipation  
bring great joy and fun  
into the day after day under the sun.  

And also, as often happens  
when spirit takes form,  
reality is different from  
the imagined ideal  
and we feel disappointment.  

The expectations of others on us  
can at times be too much to bear.  
They can weigh us down  
and overwhelm us with despair.  

The world expects so much  
if you want to be accepted in society.  
And God help you if you refuse  
or challenge its standards.  
It's not typically taken politely.  
Somtimes even violently.    
Get ready to be alone,  
cast out, or disowned.  

And what of the expectations  
that we place on ourselves?  
Or that we internalize  
from those we defined us?  

The people, situations, and environments  
that deeply shape our sense of self  
can be both a ligament that holds us together  
and bonds us to others,  
and also a chain that imprisons us  
in the will and desire of others.  

Can we allow and accept disappiontment?  
Can I allow and accept disappointment?  

In a way, disappointment -  
as painful as it may be -  
is the freedom I long for.  
A release from expectation  
and its constant scrutiny.  

It may not be as satisfying  
as the fulfillment of expectations,  
but there is healing and new life  
in the freedom that it contains  
when I can see it as a release of   
something with no life outside of my imagination,  
and not as the final word in my story.  

And then I take a deep breath,  
pause, rest, reflect, and reset.  
Update my internal understanding  
to more closely match reality.  

And begin again to soar  
as high as I dare to fly.  

Some days life just says,  
"Here, have some humility."  
So I just say,  
"Okay. Thank you."
