# Expectations

How do you handle all of the expectations of life, and of the world? 
How do handle your own expectations? 

In some ways, expectations and anticipation bring great joy and fun into an otherwise mundane existence. 
And also, as often happens when spirit takes form, reality is not exactly like the imagined ideal and we often feel disappointed. 

The expectations of others on us can at times be simply too much to bear, 
They can weigh us down and overwhelm us with despair. 

The world expects so much if you wan to be accepted into society. 
And God help you if you refuse or challenge those expectations. 
It's often not taken politely. 
Somtimes even violently. 

And what of the expectations that we place on ourselves? 
Or that we have internalized from parents and family? 
The people, situations, and environments that deeply shape our sense of self 
can be both a ligament that holds us together and bonds us to others, 
and also a chain that imprisons us in the will and desire of others. 

Can we allow and accept disappiontment? 
Can I allow and accept disappointment? 

In a way, disappointment - as painful as it may be sometimes - is the freedom I long for. 
A release from expectation. 

It may not be as satisfying as the fulfillment of expectations, 
but it can still bring a kind of healing and new life 
in the freedom that it contains if I can see it not as the final word in my story, 
but as the end of an expectation that simply had no fulfillment outside of my imagination. 

And now I can take a deep breath, 
pause, rest, and reset, 
update my internal understanding 
with a model that more closely matches reality, 
and begin again to fly. 

Some days life just says, 
"Here, have some humility." 
So I just say, 
"Okay. Thank you!"
