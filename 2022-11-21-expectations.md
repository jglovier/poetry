# Expectations

How do you handle  
all of the expectations of life,  
and of the world?  
How do handle  
your own expectations?  

In some ways, expectations and anticipation  
bring great joy and fun  
into the day after day under the sun.  

And also, as often happens  
when spirit takes form,  
reality is different from  
the imagined ideal  
and we often feel disappointed.  

The expectations of others on us  
can at times be simply too much to bear.  
They can weigh us down  
and overwhelm us with despair.  

The world expects so much  
if you want to be accepted into society.  
And God help you if you refuse  
or challenge its standards.  
It's often not taken politely.  
Somtimes even violently.  

And what of the expectations  
that we place on ourselves?  
Or that received from 
those we defined us?  

The people, situations, and environments  
that deeply shape our sense of self  
can be both a ligament that holds us together  
and bonds us to others,  
and also a chain that imprisons us 
in the will and desire of others.  

Can we allow and accept disappiontment?  
Can I allow and accept disappointment?  

In a way, disappointment -  
as painful as it may -  
is the freedom I long for.  
A release from expectation  
and its constant scrutiny.  

It may not be as satisfying  
as the fulfillment of expectations,  
but it can still bring a kind of healing and new life  
in the freedom that it contains  
if I can see it not as the final word in my story,  
but simply as the letting go of an expectation  
that had no fulfillment outside of my imagination.  

And now I can take a deep breath,  
pause, rest, and reset.  
Update my internal understanding  
with a model that more closely matches reality,  
and begin again to fly.  

Some days life just says,  
"Here, have some humility."  
So I just say,  
"Okay. Thank you."
