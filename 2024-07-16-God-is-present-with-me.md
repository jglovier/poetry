In my pain
God is present with me.

In my joy
God is present with me.

When life doesn't make sense
God is present with me.

When people don't make sense
God is present with me.

When I feel so very loved by others
God is present with me.

When I feel despised and uncared for
God is present with me.

When love and joy are bursting forth
God is present with me.

When hope feels thousands of miles away
God is present with me.

When I feel rejected and cast out
God is present with me.

When I am right where I belong
God is present with me.

I am always right where I belong
because God is present with me.
